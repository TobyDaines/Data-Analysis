# Coding Tasks

This is a repository of various coding tasks that I completed during my online Data Science Bootcamp with CoGrammar/HyperionDev.
Each tasks aims to hone in on a new skill and extract meaningful insights hidden in the data.

## titanic.ipynb

This is an exploratory data analysis of the titanic dataset which aims to assess the key factors which affected survival rate on the Titanic.
I have included numerous visualisations and statistics to determine factors which affected survival rate the most as well as those which had little effect.
I have also aimed to answer questions such as whether or not first class passengers were likely given preference of lifeboats, adding to the level of detail of my data analysis.

## Kmeans_task.ipynb

This is a file that delves into the intricacies of the unsupervised machine learning algorithm k-means clustering.
This file shows how to implement a k-means clustering algorithm in Python.
It also depicts an idea of how closely the hidden patterns discovered accurately represent the real data and the factors separating each cluster and how can label them.
